## Design Direction

The design should feel clean, modern, and calming - similar to premium productivity apps like Things 3 or Apple Reminders, with generous white space and subtle shadows that create depth without distraction.

- **Primary Color**: Soft Blue (oklch(0.65 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, focus, and productivity
- **Secondary Colors**: Light gray backgrounds (oklch(0.98 0.01 240)) for subtle container definition
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.75 0.15 60)) - For completion states and positive feedback
